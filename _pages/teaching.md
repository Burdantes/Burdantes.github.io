I was twice a Course Assistant for <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~misra/6180.html" >CSEEW6180 Modeling Performance Evaluation</a> (old website) with Professor Vishal Misra. My job consisted of writing and grading homeworks and final exams and holding office hours.

Throughout the past few years, I have been mentoring a few very bright undergraduate students on a wide array of subjects:
<ul>
   <li>Cyrus Illick (Fall 2021 - Now) on a new protocol to avoid broadcasting storm</li>
   <li>Joshua Hahn (Summer 2022 - Now) on emulating causal models and understand how synthetic control recovers the underlying latent space.</li>
   <li>Dominic Sobhani (Summer 2022 - Now) on a transformer architecture to simulate Internet traffic data.</li>
   <li>Alfonso Luis (Fall 2022 - Now) on sampling without replacements and Bloom Filters </li>
</ul>
