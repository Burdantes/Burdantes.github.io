I had the pleasure of serving as a Course Assistant on two occasions for <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~misra/6180.html" >CSEEW6180 Modeling Performance Evaluation</a> (old website) with Professor Vishal Misra. My responsibilities encompassed drafting and evaluating homework, overseeing the final examinations, and conducting office hours.

Over recent years, I've had the honor of mentoring several exceptional undergraduate scholars on diverse research topics:.
<ul>
   <li>Cyrus Illick (Fall 2021 - Spring 2023) on a new protocol to avoid broadcasting storm : starting Ph.D. at Columbia University in Fall 2023 </li>
   <li>Joshua Hahn (Summer 2022 - Fall 2022) on emulating causal models and understand how synthetic control recovers the underlying latent space.</li>
   <li>Dominic Sobhani (Summer 2022 - Spring 2023) on a transformer architecture to simulate Internet traffic data.</li>
   <li>Alfonso Luis (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023) on sampling without replacements and Bloom Filters. </li>
   <li> Seung Joon Rhee (Summer 2023 - Now) on inferring and geolocating hypergiants peering connections </li>  
   <li> Kylie Berg (Summer 2023 - Now) on quantum networking verification </li> 
</ul>
