I am a third year Ph.D. student at Columbia University supervised by Pr. Ethan Katz-Bassett, Pr. Vishal Misra and Pr. Daniel Rubenstein. My main interests are in internet measurement, complex systems analysis, and information geometry. I am working on finding new models to understand the interactions between virtual and geographical space. I like to leverage theory to validate qualitative models on top of carefully crafted measurements.

In my free time, I like to collect jazz records and do improvisation. I am also an avid poetry reader and a friend chicken eater.
