<div style="text-align: left"> I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University, under the supervision of Professors Ethan Katz-Bassett, Vishal Misra, and Daniel Rubenstein. My research focuses on Internet measurement, model analysis, and Riemannian geometry, aiming to develop models that bridge virtual and geographical spaces. While my work is primarily theoretical, I enjoy building systems that support these theories.

I also enjoy teaching and mentoring students. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in research projects or have questions about grad school.

Outside academia, I am an avid jazz record collector and a big foodie.




<h3>Current research interests:</h3>

<ul>
<li> Internet Measurement and topology discovery</li>
<li> Mathematical modeling of the Internet </li>
<li> Resilient networking </li>
<li> Mathematical analysis of systems </li>
<li> Computational social science on computer networks</li>
<li> Riemannian geometry </li>

</ul>

<h3>Teaching Service: </h3>


I served twice as a Course Assistant for <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~misra/6180.html" >CSEEW6180 Modeling Performance Evaluation</a> (old website) with Professor Vishal Misra. My duties included drafting and grading homework, overseeing final exams, and conducting office hours.




<h3>Mentoring:</h3>

Over recent years, I've had the honor of mentoring several exceptional undergraduate scholars on diverse research topics:.
<ul>
   <li>Cyrus Illick (Fall 2021 - Spring 2023) on a new protocol to avoid broadcasting storm: starting Ph.D. at Columbia University in Fall 2023 </li>
   <li>Joshua Hahn (Summer 2022 - Fall 2022) on emulating causal models and understanding how synthetic control recovers the underlying latent space.</li>
   <li>Dominic Sobhani (Summer 2022 - Spring 2023) on a transformer architecture to simulate Internet traffic data.</li>
   <li>Alfonso Luis (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023) on sampling without replacements and Bloom Filters. </li>
   <li> Seung Joon Rhee (Summer 2023 - Now) on inferring and geolocating hypergiants peering connections </li>  
   <li> Kylie Berg (Summer 2023 - Now) on quantum networking verification </li>
</ul>
