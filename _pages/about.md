I am a rising fourth year Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University supervised by Pr. Ethan Katz-Bassett, Pr. Vishal Misra and Pr. Daniel Rubenstein.  My research is deeply rooted in the exploration of Internet measurement, models analysis, and Riemannian geometry. I am working on finding new models to understand the interactions between virtual and geographical space. A significant facet of my work revolves around devising innovative models that bridge our understanding between the virtual and geographical space. I am interested in applying theoretical frameworks to substantiate qualitative models, supported by thoughtfully crafted measurements. While my work leans more towards the theoretical aspect rather than pure engineering, I like the challenge of constructing systems that bolster theoretical foundations.

I also get a great deal of satisfaction out of teaching and mentoring students so feel free to reach out to me if you are looking for research project or have interrogations about grad school.  

Outside the academic realm, I'm an avid collector of jazz records and have a penchant for Iranian cuisine. I am also a big Football Manager player.
