AInspired by stories from my grandfather, a political activist who took refuge in France, I developed a profound interest in political science. His dream of igniting an intellectual renaissance in a nation shaped by ancient civilization's history and an enduring pursuit of freedom deeply resonated with me. My academic inclinations led me towards mathematical modeling, which I found to be an efficient tool for abstract reasoning, allowing me to focus on the foundational structure of problems. This approach formed the cornerstone of my first five years at university.

While I pursued my undergraduate studies in mathematics, I maintained a keen interest in the political dynamics of Iran, Russia, and the Black Sea region. A pivotal moment came during my research internship in South Korea, where I discovered the potential of network analysis in understanding human behaviors and the emergence of political phenomena. This realization set the groundwork for my future research: to view political events through the lens of networks and mathematics.

In 2019-2020, I delved into analyzing Russia’s influence on Twitter. I developed tools that provided quantitative evidence to support or refute hypotheses presented by my political science peers. Furthermore, I collaborated in crafting a standardized methodology for representing graphs, based on the spring layout. This methodology is now taught as part of the master of geopolitics in the University of Paris VIII. Our research has illuminated instances where Russian influences were erroneously cited in previous French controversies.
