After learning about Iranian politics from my grandfather, a political activist who fled to France, my interest in political science flourished from his dream: an intellectual awakening of a nation enriched by the history of an early civilization and a constant quest for freedom. Early on, I was drawn to mathematical modeling to reason through a problem by abstraction of the problem’s specificity. The capacity of thinking in terms of underlying structure and their properties motivated my first five years of university. In parallel with my mathematics undergrad, I consistently kept up with political affairs in Iran, Russia, the Black Sea. During my first research internship in South Korea, I came to realize that networks were a fertile environment to understand human behavior, where one could also observe the emergence of political phenomena. At that time, I had unconsciously laid the foundation for some of the research I would perform later: The idea of approaching political phenomena through the prism of networks and mathematics. In 2019-2020, I examined Russia’s influence in Twitter by building tools to quantitatively support (or infirm) reasoning made by colleagues who were experts in political science. I have also participated in building a standardized methodology to represent graph based on spring layout that is now used in Cassini, a consulting start-up in France. Our work has proven in the past that Russian influences have been used as a scapegoat in past controversies in France.
