In this project, we show that Iran has leveraged BGP to achieve three specific strategic goals: 1) the pursuit of a self-sustaining national Internet with controlled borders as seemed to have been used in the current events 2) the desire to set up an Iranian Intranet to facilitate censorship which is a passive consequence from the architecture 3) the leverage of connectivity as a tool of regional influence through BGP dependencies. We show that the evolution of the Iranian AS landscape has happened along with a bigger governmental control.
We also note that the Iranian government has been using BGP-tampering for the past few years with increasingly high firepower.

The complete shutdown we observe in November 2019 and again in September 2022 are the latest and most massive event of a larger set of BGP related events that Iran that has been witnessed has been for now more than 10 years. We observe that Iran has been able to develop a BGP strategy that enables it to fully control its network without reducing its resilience. We finally note that the Iranian network is connected to the rest of the world through a very number of limited ASes. This leads us to our conclusion that Iran has the potential to completely isolate its network from the rest of the world. This research has led to a paper at the Journal of Cybersecurity and the technical contributions have led to a new approach to perform intelligence through protocol data currently taught at the French Institute of Geopolitics in Paris.
