The Internet is constituted of thousands of ISPs inter-operating autonomous parts of the Internet. By establishing connection agreements between themselves via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), ISPs (in the form of ASes) allow data to flow from one point to another around the globe. The way these entities collaborate, and in particular, their integration within the rest of the network, responds to geographical, commercial, and political constraints. Relationships emerge in the form of BGP agreements and materialize in terms of physical cables connecting two routers within constrained geographic boundaries called {\em interconnections}. Uncovering the interconnections that tile the Internet is notoriously difficult as has been shown by the previous rich literature focused on that question and would have applications in a large array of research areas. In this paper, we introduce a new system, named Pythia, to discover missing peering links for targeted ASes within a specific geographic boundary. This work is currently in progress and is expected to be published soon.
